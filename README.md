# README - Helena Spencer

For this assignment, I chose to develop a personal portfolio. My main goals were to showcase a few of my recent projects and provide information about myself to the viewer. I'll go into more detail below.

## Description

The purpose of my website is to display the work/projects I have done in school as well as allow the viewer to get to know me a bit. I intentionally made it so that the project cards on the "Projects" page are not clickable just because I did not have time to implement a details page for each individual project. The information conveyed on my website is a summary ("Home") page which has my most recent work, an "About" page which goes into my three areas of life such as being a student, athlete, and my interests, and then my "Projects" page which has the relevant projects that I have done thus far. My website is engaging because it uses fun animations and bright colors. I also tried to keep the amount of content on the screen to a minimal so it wouldn't overwhelm the viewer. The target audience is for anyone who wants to learn more about me and what projects I have done, but primarily, potential recruiters and employers.
