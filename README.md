# README - Helena Spencer

For this assignment, I chose to develop a personal portfolio. My main goals were to showcase a few of my recent projects and provide information about myself to the viewer. I'll go into more detail below.

## Description

The purpose of my website is to display the work/projects I have done in school as well as allow the viewer to get to know me a bit. I intentionally made it so that the project cards on the "Projects" page are not clickable just because I did not have time to implement a details page for each individual project. The information conveyed on my website is a summary ("Home") page which has my most recent work, an "About" page which goes into my three areas of life such as being a student, athlete, and my interests, and then my "Projects" page which has the relevant projects that I have done thus far. My website is engaging because it uses fun animations and bright colors. I also tried to keep the amount of content on the screen to a minimal so it wouldn't overwhelm the viewer. The target audience is for anyone who wants to learn more about me and what projects I have done, but primarily, potential recruiters and employers.

## Usage of Website

- All pages
  - At the top of every page is a navigation bar with the different pages. If you scroll down at all, the navigation bar turns into a hamburger menu located at the top right of the screen.
- Home Page
  - Learn More button
    - Scroll past the main background picture to the "Learn More" button and click on it. You should then be redirected to the "About" page.
  - Recent Work carousel
    - At the bottom of the Home page, there is a carousel displaying my recent projects. To see different projects, click on the arrows to the left and right of the images.
 - About page
  - Hoverable Columns
    - In the *Athlete* section, if you hover over any of the images/text, the image for that column turns from grayscale to colored, the header for the trait turns red, and the text changes weight slightly.
 - Projects page
  - Filterable Cards
  - The projects cards are filterable. If you click on the "All", "Applications", or "Websites" buttons, the corresponding projects are displayed.
 - Contact page
