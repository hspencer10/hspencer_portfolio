        <p class="text-start">My name is Helena Spencer and I am currently a Junior majoring in Information Systems and double minoring in Human Computer Interactions (HCI) and Societal and Human Impacts on Future Technologies (SHIFT) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I not only play for the varsity women's soccer team, but also represent the entire CMU student-athlete population through my position as President of the Student-Athlete Advisory Council (SAAC) and University Leadership Student Advisory Council (ULSAC).
        </p>
        <p class="text-start">Over the past couple of years I have been heavily involved with the human centered software development process and gained numerous tools and techniques to grasp a better understanding of clientele. These tools include creating mockups, story boards, style guides, wireframes, affinity diagrams, journey maps, and various fidelity prototypes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-start">The most engaging course I have taken thus far is Information Systems Consulting (course number 67-443) where we work with a community partner to help identify pain points and resolve them. My team worked with First Tee Pittsburgh (FTP) where we developed a server-side automation process to bridge the communication gap between coaches and parents. This process consisted of connecting FTP's Salesforce database to Google Calendar using APIs and additionally linking the Twilio API to Google Calendar so whenever edits were made, texts and notifications were sent out automatically.

        <p class="text-start">If it isn't obvious already, I am a huge Marvel and Disney fan. Part of the love comes from growing up with iconic Disney movies and shows but most of it is because I treasure the underlying messages that are displayed. Through Marvel Avengers movies specifically, I learned being unique is a strength and when these differences are combined on a team, it makes it that much stronger. Additionally, these movies exemplify living life in service of others and that even the simplest acts of kindness and selflessness can have the biggest impacts on the world.
        </p>
        <p class="text-start">Another hobby of mine is building various items with my dad. Whether it be for a school project or a personal need, for instance furniture, I have always enjoyed the hands-on aspect of building and the bonus of being able to spend quality time with my dad. I like to believe this is where I get my creative side from since these projects involved brainstorming various ideas, planning how to execute an idea, and then problem-solving issues that arise while we are in the process of building the item itself.
        </p>
        <p class="text-start">I also love to travel. Growing up in a military family, I have had to move around about every 4 years which has given me the opportunity to see so many places and cultures that not everyone gets to experience which I am extremely grateful for. My favorite place I have ever lived was Japan because of the crystal clear oceans and hibachi restaurants. Visiting this beautiful island is on my long list of places to travel to when I get the chance.
